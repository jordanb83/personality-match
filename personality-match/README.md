## Personality Match

Personality Match assesses the user's personality type indicators from three tests (Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, and Instinctual Variant) and finds 
the Notable Figures who best match the user's scores. The degree of certainty in propesed matches can be evaluated with logit functions. 

The SQL DB was constructed with data from https://www.personality-database.com

Soon, I'll implement a single test that determines the user's three personality type indicators at once. 
Until then, you can find your indicators with these tests:
